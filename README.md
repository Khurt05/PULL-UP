# PULL-UP RENTAL

Simple static web app for browsing and renting cars.

## Features
- Responsive listing of available cars
- Search with live suggestions
- "More" button to load additional cars dynamically
- Mobile-friendly dropdown and layout

## Quick start
1. Open `structure.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with a simple HTTP server:
   - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
   - Then visit: `http://localhost:8000/structure.html`
2. Edit styles in `style.css` and behavior in `Scripts/script.js`.

## Notes
- Ensure file and folder names are case-correct on Linux (e.g. `Scripts/` vs `scripts/`).
- Replace placeholder images in the `image/` folder as needed.
